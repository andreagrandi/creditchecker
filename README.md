creditchecker
=============

Credit Checker is an application for Maemo platform that is be able to return the available credit of a mobile carrier from the personal area of the carrier website

Usually people have to start a web browser, authenticate to the carrier's website, go to the personal panel and read the available credit.

At the moment Credit Checker only supports Italian carrier 3HG Italy (http://www.tre.it). Spanish Simyo and Yoigo are a work in progress. I hope to be able to support as much as carriers I can, with the help of peple who want to write a python class for their carrier or providing me enough information to be able to write it.

Note: Credit Checker is still a work in progress. It still needs lot of refactoring since the original idea of releasing only the backend library. I'll add notes for developers as soon as possible, to make easier for other people to add support for their own carrier.
